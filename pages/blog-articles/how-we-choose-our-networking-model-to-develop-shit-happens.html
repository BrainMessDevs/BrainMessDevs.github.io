    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <br><br/>
      <p>When it comes to game development, one thing is clear to every developer: Creating a multiplayer game is difficult. Or, at least that's how I felt when we started developing our first one. Taking the first step of starting to develop a multiplayer game is quite a challenge, however, as you start working on the project it can also be exciting. Who doesn't want to create an online MMORPG with MOBA mechanics for thousands of players? Well—We do!. But when you start to realize the number of systems and details you have to take into account, the dream of creating that game on a large scale slips away like sand through your hands.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>One of the best piece of advice I've received in my career is to start small and iterate. This way, you can create a simple game that has just enough features to be fun and engaging for your users. Don't try to make the next big hit of the moment. Try to make something that people actually want to use and play with their friends—and then, after a while, when you have enough data from your users' behavior and money, you can set up a team and start working on the next big hit.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>So… that's what we did - we started developing a prototype for this game that's part cooperative, part party game. We kept a super small scope to focus on learning the ins and outs of multiplayer game development. Our goal was clear: to create a fun multiplayer game while gaining valuable experience along the way.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>We came up with an idea for a social deduction game called Shit Happens. We'll explore in more detail later, but to make it happen, we needed to choose a networking model that would fit our needs perfectly. It was all about finding the right balance to bring our vision to life.</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row-centered">
      <h2>Exploring Different Multiplayer Models</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p>Choosing the right networking model for a game can be troublesome, but by asking the right questions about your needs, you'll have a better idea of which one to pick.</p>
      <p>Each model comes with its own set of advantages and considerations. Let's take a closer look at some common multiplayer models:</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 60px;"><b>1.</b></span><b> Local Multiplayer:</b> This is the simplest model where multiple players can use controllers on the same machine. It works great for party games and makes client application development a breeze.
      </p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 60px;"><b>2.</b></span><b> LAN (Local Area Network):</b> In this model, the server is hosted on a shared network, resulting in low latency and no reliance on back-end services. LAN multiplayer is often found in competitive eSports games.
      </p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 60px;"><b>3.</b></span><b> Peer-to-Peer: </b> In peer-to-peer multiplayer, clients update each other on separate machines and networks. There are two variations of this model:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="text-indent: 60px; display: inline-block; width: 120px;"><b>a)</b></span><b> Direct Peer-to-Peer:</b> In this setup, all machines are directly connected to each other. While it offers simplicity, it can pose scalability issues and security concerns.
      </p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row-centered">
      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
        <img src="../../assets/images/blog-articles/article_2/P2P-Direct.webp" alt="#"/>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <br><br/>
      <p>
        <span style="text-indent: 60px; display: inline-block; width: 120px;"><b>b)</b></span><b> Client-Server Peer-to-Peer:</b> Here, one client runs the server logic, reducing the number of connections and improving scalability. However, it's important to address host advantage and host migration, which can potentially cause issues.
      </p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row-centered">
      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
        <img src="../../assets/images/blog-articles/article_2/P2P-Client-Server.webp" alt="#"/>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <br><br/>
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 60px;"><b>4.</b></span><b> Dedicated Server:</b> With a dedicated server model, the server logic is hosted externally, allowing players to connect as clients. This model offers high performance and eliminates host advantage. However, cost and scalability considerations should be taken into account.
      </p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row-centered">
      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
        <img src="../../assets/images/blog-articles/article_2/DedicatedServer.webp" alt="#"/>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <br><br/>
      <p>So, to determine the right model for our game, we created a list of categories to analyze each case based on the mechanics of our prototype. The most important categories that emerged from that brainstorming session were:</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 40px;"><b>1.</b></span><b> Player Capacity:</b> How many players do you anticipate participating in your game simultaneously?
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 40px;"><b>2.</b></span><b> Latency and Performance:</b> If your game is fast-paced and requires quick responsiveness, minimizing latency and ensuring smooth performance is crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 40px;"><b>3.</b></span><b> Security and Anti-Cheating Measures:</b> Protecting your game from malicious activities and cheating is essential for maintaining a fair and enjoyable multiplayer environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 40px;"><b>4.</b></span><b> Back-End Services:</b> Determine whether your game needs additional back-end services, such as matchmaking, leaderboards, or player persistence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 40px;"><b>5.</b></span><b> Development Resources and Learning Curve:</b> Analyze the resources, tutorials, and documentation offered by the networking solution. Take into account the learning curve associated with integrating and using the solution in your game.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; width: 40px;"><b>6.</b></span><b> Cost and Licensing:</b> Examine the pricing structure and licensing requirements of the networking solution. Ensure it aligns with your budget and business model. Be aware that some solutions may involve upfront fees, royalties, or usage limitations that need to be taken into account.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <br><br/>
      <p>With all this information, we decided to create a comparison table to showcase our needs and the advantages and disadvantages of each model, so we could choose the right one:</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row-centered">
      <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
        <img src="../../assets/images/blog-articles/article_2/networking-table-models.webp" alt="#"/>
      </div>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row-centered">
      <h2>The case of <i>Shit Happens</i></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p><i>Shit Happens</i> is an online multiplayer party game for 3 to 6 players, set in various locations. In each round, one player takes on the role of the "pooper" and must find a discreet spot to poop without getting caught. Meanwhile, the other players work to identify and catch the pooper, using abilities and items to investigate and evade detection.</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p><b>Player Capacity</b></p>
      <p>The game features an online mode where a group of players join the same match to find the "pooper". The minimum number of players in this case is 3, and the maximum is 6; however, the maximum might change in the future depending on how the game scales during playtests, so that number should be flexible. In this category, the best option would be peer-to-peer, as a dedicated server might be too much for the expected number of players per match. Nevertheless, the total number of simultaneous players the game could have should be considered, as that could also change the model to be used. For example, Team17, the studio behind Overcooked!, initially used a peer-to-peer model but switched to dedicated servers during development.</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p><b>Latency and Performance</b></p>
      <p>The gameplay of the game is quite simple, so there's no need for high precision when calculating player movements or actions. So, in this case, using a dedicated server feels like putting a Lamborghini engine on a bicycle.</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p><b>Security and Anti-Cheating Measures</b></p>
      <p>While the game is based on a competitive mode, where one side must win, at the moment, addressing potential cheats isn't our top priority. This gives us more flexibility in choosing other key factors for the game's development.</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p><b>Back-End Services</b></p>
      <p>Initially, Shit Happens will need at least a lobby service to create matches. With this minimal requirement, the game could be published and gradually progress towards a more robust matchmaking model that allows players to create and joining various types of matches and join them. That being said, in all cases, these systems need to be developed, so that no model stands out above the others. However, some networking solutions offer matchmaking or relay features, such as Steam Datagram Relay or Unity Relay Service, which could influence the decision between one model or another.</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p><b>Development Resources and Learning Curve</b></p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, the game's core mechanics are quite basic, such as simple character movement, picking up items and using them, all of this to find the "pooper", which would most likely require a line of sight or systems to detect that character, while they're hiding their "treasure." Beyond that, there's no other complexity except for networking-related aspects like matchmaking, lobbies, or even synchronization and movement prediction. Keep in mind, though, that this could increase the learning curve since developing in-house networking systems can be both costly and complicated. This highlights the advantage of peer-to-peer connections, which can facilitate these types of implementations.</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p><b>Cost and Licensing</b></p>
      <p>In terms of budget, since we are working on a game prototype that will help us learn more about networking implementations, the cost should be as close to zero as possible. With this in mind, the option of a dedicated server fades away due to the high maintenance costs, not to mention the implementation expenses. However, the chosen solution should consider the possibility of future migration, as the prototype might grow enough to require dedicated servers and secure the necessary budget for maintenance.</p>
      <p>While offering players the ability to host their own servers is tempting, a peer-to-peer model where one of the clients also acts as the host is the most accessible choice in this case.</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row-centered">
      <h2>The final decision</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <p>Taking into account all these particularities, we're strongly leaning towards using a client-server network model, expressed as a listening server, where one of the players acts as the session host. This is especially appealing since it also allows us the option to eventually transfer the server functionality and hosting to dedicated servers when the business needs justify it. This approach keeps the prototype development flexible and lets the server model change at a later date based on the game's success and players' needs.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>In the next post, we'll dive deeper into choosing a networking solution to achieve the implementation of the model we've selected. With so many options out there, it becomes a challenge to find the right solution that meets our needs. That's why we believe that a thorough analysis will give us a better overview of the best option to cover all our requirements. See you in the next one!</p>
