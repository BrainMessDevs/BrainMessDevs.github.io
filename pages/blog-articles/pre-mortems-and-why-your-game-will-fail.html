    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <br><br/>
      <p>Let's face it: game development is a risky business. I've had my fair share of failures in my career. Sometimes it's because I couldn't get the funding I needed or the tech just wasn't there yet. But most of the time, it's because I failed to anticipate an inevitable crash.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>To succeed in this industry, you have to be constantly moving forward. As I see it, gaming is a unique art form - it's always evolving, changing, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. It's not like Amazon, where people just want their packages delivered ASAP; gaming is all about creating experiences that resonate with players on a deeper level, it’s an art, a culture, and an experience that's always moving forward.</p>
      <p>And if you're not moving with it, you're screwed. So, how do you keep up with the times, and launch a successful game in six or twelve months? It takes <b>collaborative effort</b>, with designers, developers, artists, and business professionals all working together to create something truly amazing. At its core, game development is an alchemy of art, design, technology, culture, and business knowledge - and it's only by combining all of these elements that you can truly succeed.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>But collaboration is only the first step. To create a truly successful game, you also need to mix and match gameplay mechanics, get the core gameplay just right, and most importantly, understand your audience. It's a challenging process, but if you can do it, the rewards are worth it. Who wouldn't want to launch a game that's fresh, relevant, and that players love?</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row-centered">
      <h2>Making decisions</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <br><br/>
      <p>Alright, so you've got a solid concept for your game. Time to start making some decisions! But how do you make sure you're making the right ones?</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>According to some of the top minds in the industry, it all comes down to the Magical Pair - two game developers who work together to shape the vision of the game. They're the ones making the tough decisions, and they do it by constantly revising and iterating their concept until it's just right.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>But here's the thing: even the best Magical Pair can't catch everything. Sometimes, team members are hesitant to speak up and voice their concerns during the planning phase, and that can lead to some serious issues down the line.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>That's why it's important to make sure dissenting voices are heard. If someone on your team has reservations about the project, it's better to address those concerns early on rather than later, when it could be too late. After all, in the world of game development, time is money - and you don't want to waste either on a project that's doomed to fail.</p>
      <br><br/>
    </div>
    <div class="row-centered">
      <h2>Pre-Mortems</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row mx-auto">
      <br><br/>
      <p>One method that is gaining popularity in the game development community is the pre-mortem. According to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227768493_Back_to_the_future_Temporal_perspective_in_the_explanation_of_events" target="_blank">research</a> conducted in 1989 by Deborah J. Mitchell, Jay Russo, and Nancy Pennington, prospective hindsight, or imagining that an event has already occurred, can increase the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by 30%. In other words, by imagining all the possible ways a project could fail before it actually does.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>A pre-mortem is the opposite of a post-mortem, but similar in many ways. It's a way to analyze a project before it even begins, with the goal of identifying potential problems and weaknesses that could lead to its failure. The idea is to assume that the project has already failed, and then work backwards to figure out why. This allows the team to generate plausible reasons for the project's failure, and to address those issues before they become a problem.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>To run a pre-mortem, start by setting up a meeting with your game development team. During the meeting, ask team members to generate plausible reasons for the project's failure. Give everyone a chance to speak freely, and encourage them to write down every reason they can think of for the failure. After everyone has had a chance to share their thoughts, review the list of potential failure situations and use them to improve the project.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>It's also a good idea to bring in people from outside the project, as they may be able to see issues that the team is too close to the project to notice. Once potential failure situations have been identified, it's important to give the team leads autonomy to work on those issues without pressure. Pre-mortems should be repeated during the early phases of the project to ensure that all possible issues are addressed and that potential failure situations don't get swept under the rug.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>Have you heard of <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1Mr3oKR7oM" target="_blank">Pixar's Braintrust</a>? It's like a pre-mortem for their movies. Basically, they bring together a bunch of people - about twenty - and have the director, producer, and other team members explain the status and storyline of the movie. They do this every few months to assess each movie they're making. The goal is to put smart, passionate people in a room together to identify and solve problems, and encourage everyone to be candid.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>The Braintrust has no authority, and the director doesn't have to follow any specific suggestions. It's up to the director to figure out how to address the feedback. Most importantly, it's the film that's under review, not the filmmaker. So, it's a constructive criticism session to make the movie better.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>But, why is Braintrust useful? Well, as a company grows, the need for a product drives the output, not the strength of the ideas at the front end. And one of the crucial aspects of the Braintrust is developing full candor amongst the team. In a one-on-one environment, we are usually open; but when we're in a group, our animal instincts start to kick in, and fear takes over. We want to secure a reasonable opinion that everyone likes and not be the rebel in the room.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>Catmull, the co-founder of Pixar, confirms that "Candor could not be more crucial to our creative process. Why? Because early on, all of our movies suck. That's a blunt assessment, but saying it in a softer way fails to convey how bad the first versions really are."</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>So, how can we apply the Braintrust concept to gaming? Well, Catmull recommends choosing people that make you think smarter, putting lots of solutions on the table, and finding people who will level with you. The Braintrust is made up of people with a deep understanding of storytelling, who usually have been through the process themselves. So, start with game designers and product people, and then carefully expand. Over time, the Braintrust will have evolved from a tight, well-defined group working on a single film into a larger, more fluid group.</p>
      <br><br/>
      <p>Unfortunately, it can be hard to uphold a Braintrust. You need someone to own it and make sure that the compact upon which the meetings are based is protected and upheld. It is important that the people within the Braintrust do not hold back: the fear of saying something stupid or looking bad should be avoided without offending or intimidating someone.</p>
